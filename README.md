# Billing-Automated

This project was done to automate the billing process in super markets. 2 rasberry pis are set in the trolley that is used for shopping. Each time, a product is placed in the trolley, it is identified by the model and is added to the bill. Likewise, if it is taken away, it is removed from the bill. 

Right now, only the best trained model and the detection part is available.
